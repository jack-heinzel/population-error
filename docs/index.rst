population-error
================

Welcome to the documentation for **population-error**, a `JAX` based python package for calculating the information loss due to Monte Carlo approximations in hierarchical inference. This package is intended for use with gravitational-wave population analyses. It is designed to interface easily with `gwpopulation <https://colmtalbot.github.io/gwpopulation/guide/index.html>`_, but is designed to be lightweight and flexible enough to interface with any general population analysis scheme.
